"""Webhook signing and verification utilities with version management (BE-087).

This module provides signature generation and verification with explicit versioning support.
Versioning enables safe evolution of signing algorithms without breaking existing consumers.

## Signature Versions

### Version 1 (Current - SHA256 HMAC)
- Algorithm: HMAC-SHA256
- Format: `sha256={hex_digest}`
- Payload: Raw JSON string
- Header: `X-Webhook-Signature: sha256={hex_digest}`
- Version Header: `X-Webhook-Signature-Version: 1`

Future versions (e.g., EdDSA, RSA-PSS) can be added while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Timestamp Validation Semantics

### Receiver-Facing Contract
Webhooks include an explicit timestamp in the payload (`timestamp` field) for:
1. **Idempotency**: Detect and deduplicate retried deliveries
2. **Freshness validation**: Optional receiver-side time window validation
3. **Audit trails**: Track when events occurred vs. when they were delivered

### Timestamp Format
- ISO 8601 format: `2026-04-29T14:30:45.123456`
- Timezone: UTC
- Field location: Top-level `timestamp` in JSON payload
- Immutable: Same timestamp across all retry attempts and signature versions

### Receiver Recommendations
1. Store and compare timestamps for idempotency (database unique constraint on webhook_id + timestamp)
2. Optional: Reject timestamps outside a configurable grace period (e.g., > 1 hour old)
3. Use timestamp + delivery ID for audit logging and reconciliation
